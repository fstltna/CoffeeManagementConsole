Edit "cmc" and change the settings at the top if your CoffeeMUD server is not in /root/CoffeeMud.

You will need to run cpan and install these modules:

- UI::Dialog
- Term::ReadKey
- Term::ANSIScreen

You also need to have my CoffeeMUD Startup Script installed.

Then copy "cmc" into a directory in your path and you should be ok.
