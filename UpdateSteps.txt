Update steps:
========================================

1) Run a backup of the whole mud. #8 in cmc

2) create a new database:
	mysql -p -u coffeemud
	<put in your mysql password>
	create database coffeemud2;
	quit

3) backup fakedb using option #13, #2 in cmc

4) Update CoffeeMUD using option #13, #3 in cmc

When updating the schema you will be asked for the "old" and "new" fakedb
locations. Use these:
FAKEDBOLD: /home/cmowner/CoffeeMud/oldcm/resources/fakedb
FAKEDBNEW: /home/cmowner/CoffeeMud/resources/fakedb

The old database is "coffeemud". We are setting up the new one as "coffeemud2"
If you have already updated before then use coffeemud3, etc...

5) edit coffeemud.ini using #13, #5 to change the DBSERVICE to the coffeemud#
   you just did in the previous step. Make it look like this:
DBSERVICE=jdbc\:mysql\://localhost\:3306/coffeemud2

6) Should be all set!
